### Resource Configuration

You will need to configure the resource to include your new location.

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="cubic_shops" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.Folder name="cfg" defaultOpen>
      <FileTree.File name="config.lua" />
    </FileTree.Folder>
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>
