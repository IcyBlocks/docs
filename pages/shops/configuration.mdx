## Adding Shops

<Steps>
### Resource Configuration

You will need to configure the resource to include your new location.

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="cubic_shops" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.Folder name="cfg" defaultOpen>
      <FileTree.File name="config.lua" />

### Insert The SQL Row
 
<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  The SQL row is used to identify the owner of the shop and the location of it.
</Callout>

> Example:

```sql copy {13}
-- Insert the SQL row into the table
INSERT INTO `247_STORES` (`owned`, `owner`, `location`) VALUES ('false', NULL, '13'); -- Change the '13' to the actual location id if you have more than 13 locations
```

</Steps>

## Adding/Changing Locales

<Steps>

### Setup

Go to the 'locales' folder and create a new file with the language's code <br/>
> Example:

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="cubic_shops" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.Folder name="locales" defaultOpen>
      <FileTree.File name="fr.json" />
    </FileTree.Folder>
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

Go to the file you just created and copy & paste this:

```json filename="your_language.json" copy showLineNumbers
{
    "robbery_started": "Robbery started",
    "robbery_failed": "Robbery failed",
    "robbery_successful": "Robbery successful",
    "robbery_progress_circle": "Intimidating..",
    "open_shop": "Open Shop",
    "no_stock": "The shop doesn't have enough stock! The current stock is: ",
    "open_management": "Manage Shop",
    "cancel_sell_store": "Canceled",
    "sold_store": "Successfuly sold the shop",
    "set_item_price_label": "Set Price",
    "set_item_price_desc": "Set the item's price",
    "supply": "Supply",
    "supply_desc": "Supply your shop with more items",
    "supplier": "Supplier",
    "supplier_desc": "Purchase supplies to add into your shop",
    "vault": "Vault",
    "vault_desc": "Access the money your shop makes. Be careful as it can get robbed",
    "sell_store": "Sell Shop",
    "sell_store_desc": "Sell your shop",
    "confirmation": "Wait a second!",
    "confirmation_content": "Are you sure you want to sell your shop?",
    "store_locked": "Shop Locked",
    "store_locked_desc": "You aren't the owner of this shop!",
    "management_menu_title": "Shop Management",
    "store_unowned": "Purchase Shop",
    "store_unowned_desc": "Purchase this shop for: ",
    "success_purchased_store": "Successfuly purchased shop",
    "already_own_maximum_stores": "You already own a shop. The maximum shops to purchase is 1",
    "not_enough_money": "You don't have enough money to purchase this shop. Make sure you have the required amount of momey in your bank account",
    "store_label": "Shop",
    "supplier_label": "Supplier",
    "vault_label": "Vault",
    "no_weapon_license": "You do not have a weapon license",
    "error_occured": "An error occured when purchasing the item, please try again"
}
```

Then change the value on the right side to what you want it to say.

### Configure Ox Lib

Add this to your server.cfg & change 'your_language' to the language code.

```ini filename="server.cfg" copy
setr ox:locale your_language
```

</Steps>

## Config File
 
<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="cubic_shops" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.Folder name="cfg" defaultOpen>
      <FileTree.File name="config.lua" />
      <FileTree.File name="sv_config.lua" />
    </FileTree.Folder>
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>
